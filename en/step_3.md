title: Notes for Raspberry Pi Oracle Weather Station schools
---

If you are using one of our Oracle Weather Station kits you will have been pre-issued with a **subscription code** and a **streaming key**. These can be used to access a dedicated White Label area hosted by Initial State just for Oracle Weather Station schools.

If you can't find these details, please email weather@raspberrypi.org with your school name and address and the email address of the person who applied for the Weather Station kit.

These credentials mean you can skip these steps and go straight to the next stage.
