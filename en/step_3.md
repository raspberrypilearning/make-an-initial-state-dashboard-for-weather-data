## Registering with Initial State

As a user of one of our Oracle Weather Station kits you will have been pre-issued with a **subscription code** and a **streaming key**. These can be used to access and upload data to a dedicated White Label area hosted by Initial State just for Oracle Weather Station schools.

If you can't find these details, please email weather@raspberrypi.org with your school name and address and the email address of the person who applied for the Weather Station kit.

-Follow [this link](https://rpi.hosted-app.com/#/register/){:target="_blank"} and fill in your email address, choose a password and  then type your **subscription code** into the bottom box.
