## Registering with Initial State

As a user of one of our Oracle Weather Station kits you will have been pre-issued with a **subscription code** and a **streaming key**. These can be used to access and upload data to the dedicated White Label area hosted by Initial State, just for Oracle Weather Station schools.

If you can't find these details, please email weather@raspberrypi.org with your school name and address, and the email address of the person who applied for the Weather Station kit.

- To complete your registration, follow [this link](https://rpi.hosted-app.com/#/register/){:target="_blank"} and fill in your email address, choose a password and  then type your **subscription code** into the bottom box. If possible, please use the same email address that you used to register with the Oracle online database.

Once you're logged in, create a new **bucket** to store your data:

- If it is not already open, click on the **show/hide the shelf** button in the top left hand corner of the window. ![](images/image5.png)

- Then click on the **Create stream bucket** button. ![](images/image29.png)

- Give your new bucket a descriptive name. Note that you can use [Emojis to decorate and brighten up your dashboard](http://support.initialstate.com/knowledgebase/articles/667693-emojis){:target="_blank"}. For example, adding `:partly_sunny:` to the bucket name will place a weather symbol next to the text as it is displayed on your Initial State page. You can also use emojis with the names of the various data streams that you upload, as you'll see later.

- Check the **Configure Endpoint Keys** checkbox.

- You'll need your **Bucket Key** and **Access Key** for the next stage when you start writing code. You can either copy-and-paste them into a text file now or come back to this settings screen later.  You should see that the **Access Key** that you were issued with your subscription code matches the one shown on this screen.
