## Registering with Initial State

As a user of one of our Oracle Weather Station kits you will have been pre-issued with a **subscription code** and a **streaming key**. These can be used to access and upload data to the dedicated White Label area hosted by Initial State just for Oracle Weather Station schools.

If you can't find these details, please email weather@raspberrypi.org with your school name and address and the email address of the person who applied for the Weather Station kit.

- To complete your registration, follow [this link](https://rpi.hosted-app.com/#/register/){:target="_blank"} and fill in your email address, choose a password and  then type your **subscription code** into the bottom box.

- Once you're logged in, you can create a **bucket** to store your data.

- Click on the **show/hide the shelf** button in the top left hand cornet of the window.

- Give your new bucket a descriptive name. Note that you can use [Emojis to decorate and brighten up your dashboard](http://support.initialstate.com/knowledgebase/articles/667693-emojis){:target="_blank"}. Adding `:partly_sunny:` to the bucket name will place a weather symbol next to the text as it is displayed on your Initial State page.

- check the **configure Endpoint Keys** checkbox.

- You'll need the **Bucket** and **Access Key** for the next stage. You can either copy-and-paste them into a text file now or come back to this settings screen later.  You should see that the **Access Key** that you have been issued matches the one shown on this screen.
