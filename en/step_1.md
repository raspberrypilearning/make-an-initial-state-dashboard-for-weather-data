## Introduction

Once you're collecting data with your Oracle Weather Station, it's much easier to see how the climate is changing and identify patterns  through graphs and visualisations.

 [Initial State](https://www.initialstate.com/){:target="_blank"} is an online streaming and visualisation platform to which you can  upload time series data from your sensors, devices, software, files, or anything that can make an HTTPS request. Streaming data to your Initial State account allows you to see what is happening in real-time through colourful and customisable dashboards.

Our friends at Initial State have provided a dedicated white label platform just for Oracle Weather Station users.

### What you will make

You will write Python code to upload Weather Station data to Initial State and build simple dashboards to display, analyse and share it.
