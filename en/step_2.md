## What you will need

### Hardware

- A Raspberry Pi Oracle Weather Station kit.

You should have built and installed your Oracle Weather Station kit.  If you have not done that yet, follow [these instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/weather-station-guide/), and then come back here when you've finished!

The steps in this guide assume that you will be regularly uploading data to Initial State. You can do this *and* continue to upload data to the Oracle database.

### Software

- The [Oracle Weather Station software](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/weather-station-guide/software.md){:target="_blank"}.


 - The Python `ISStreamer` library. It can be installed by logging on to your Weather Station Pi,  opening a terminal window and typing:

     ```bash
     sudo pip3 install ISStreamer

     ```

### Additional Resources

As a user of one of our Oracle Weather Station kits you will have been pre-issued with a **subscription code** and a **streaming key**. These can be used to access and upload data to the dedicated White Label area hosted by Initial State, just for Oracle Weather Station schools.

If you can't find these details, please email weather@raspberrypi.org with your school name and address, and the email address of the person who applied for the Weather Station kit.
